# Quant Pricing Models

This repository contains implementations of core option pricing models
used in quantitative finance, built from scratch to understand both
the mathematics and computational aspects.

## Models Included
- Black–Scholes analytical pricing
- Binomial tree pricing for both American and European options 
- Monte Carlo simulation for European option valuation

This is part of my learning journey into quantitative finance.
